# Advent of Code

All of my Advent of Code attempts (starting in 2024...). Check out AoC here: https://adventofcode.com/

It's nothing too serious, mostly me just playing around with whatever language I want for the year. Sometimes
I focus on a general solution that can handle whatever input it gets (see 2023), or sometimes I set hard limits
on the size of the inputs, and focus on performance instead (see 2024).
